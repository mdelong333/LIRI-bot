Guidelines: In order to meet the Employer Competitive standards and be ready to show your application to employers, the README.md file should meet the following criteria:

Clearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why)
Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized
Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app
Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning
Contain a link to a deployed version of the app
Clearly list the technologies used in the app
State your role in the app development

Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading in this assignment.
